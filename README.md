# Video games sales analysis

In this project I will analyze the sales of video games for the online gaming store "Ice". 

The data is compiled from historical records on game sales from open sources, until the end of 2016. It contains the properties of 16,715 games - their name, platform, year of release, genre, sales in the main geographical regions, critic and user scores, and age rating.

The main goal is to find patterns that determine when games will be successful, in order to plan advertising campaigns accordingly.

The main steps will be:
- Exploring the data to learn its contents and to identify issues with its quality that should be addressed.
- Preparing the data for analysis by treating the discovered issues and calculating variables of interest in preparation for analysis, in particular the total sales of each game.
- Analyzing the data to find out how the different properties of games affect their sales.
- Creating a user profile for each region by finding their top platforms and genres, and studying the effects of the age ratings on the sales.
- Testing hypotheses regarding the difference between the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms, and of the Action and Sports genres.
- Summarizing the overall findings and producing business insights.
